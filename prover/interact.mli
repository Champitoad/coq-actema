(** This module defines deep interaction between formulas,
    which is the next step after subformula linking.
    See the comment at the start of [link.mli] for an overview.
    
    Deep interaction could eventually migrate to the plugin side : 
    instead of returning a list of [choice] to the plugin, we would return 
    a link and a substitution. Not sure it is worth the effort though. *)
