# coq-actema

## Prerequisites

If you use `nix` there is nothing to do. Otherwise you will need to install
some dependencies and set some environment variables manually.

The environment variable APIDIR should be set to the build directory of dune
for the backend of Actema:
```bash
export APIDIR=actema-desktop/prover/_build/default/libs/api
```

## Build

For some reason, the `dune` build of the `Loader.v` cannot load dynamically
dependencies of `atdgen`. So for now, we stick to using `coq_makefile` for
building the plugin.

Also, we want to have `dune` files to get correct LSP services in VSCode. But
`dune` will complain that the files generated by `make` conflict with its own
targets.

This is a bit dirty, but it entails three manual build scenarios:

1. when building for the first time, run:
    ```
    make api
    dune build
    make
    ```
2. when rebuilding *without* changing the project structure, run:
    ```
    make
    ```
3. when rebuilding *after* changing the project structure, run:
    ```
    make cleanall
    dune build
    make
    ```

## Update API

When updating the API in `actema-desktop/prover/libs/api`, one needs to import it to `src`:

```
make update-api
```
